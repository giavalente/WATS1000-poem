# Parting.
## _By Charlotte Bronte_

<br>There's no use in _weeping_,
<br>Though we are condemned to part:
<br>There's such a thing as keeping
<br>A remembrance in one's heart:

<br>There's such a thing as dwelling
<br>On the thought ourselves have nursed,
<br>And with scorn and courage telling
<br>The world to do its worst.

<br>We'll not let its follies grieve us,
<br>We'll just take them as they come;
<br>And then every day will leave us
<br>A merry laugh for home.

<br>When we've left each friend and brother,
<br>When we're parted wide and far,
<br>We will think of one another,
<br>As even better than we are.

<br>Every glorious sight above us,
<br>Every pleasant sight beneath,
<br>We'll connect with those that love us,
<br>Whom we truly love till death!

<br>In the evening, when we're sitting
<br>By the fire, perchance alone,
<br>Then shall heart with warm heart meeting,
<br>Give responsive tone for tone.

<br>We can burst the bonds which chain us,
<br>Which cold human hands have wrought,
<br>And where none shall dare restrain us
<br>We can meet again, in thought.

<br>So there's no use in weeping,
<br>Bear a cheerful spirit still;
<br>Never doubt that Fate is keeping
<br>**Future good for present ill!**
